/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Everything has some sensible defaults so you do NOT really need to
// change anything.  But here are some settings you SHOULD change to
// make it 'YOUR' server.  IF so remove the // from the line start and
// change them to your liking.

sv_public 1	// 0 if the server should not be on the public servers list
//sv_status_privacy 1	// 1 hides IP addresses from "status" replies shown to clients, 0 shows them. Enables players to identify wellknown punks on your server OR is a thread to anonymity.. depending on your point of view :)
hostname "XxX_URAL ARENA 18+ 6a6ka_B_kegax_XxX"	// this name will appear on the server list (the $g_xonoticversion gets replaced with the current version)
sv_motd "Are you sure you want this?"	// this message (unless "") is displayed to players on connect
//maxplayers 8	// number of players allowed on the server

port 26000	// the port used by the server
//You are RECOMMENDED to change this value to a free port number on your server
//above 1024. The reason is that some bad ISPs might filter "gaming" ports, and
//changing the port your server runs on may make your server available to these
//people. Changing the port breaks nothing, the default simply matches Quake as
//we use a Quake-derived protocol and didn't do our own IANA port assignment yet
//(if anyone wants to go through that process, we'd be glad).

log_file "server.log"	// server console output will also be copied to this file. This: "${serverconfig}.log" uses variable substitution to make the logfile have the same name as your config file with .log appended which is useful if you run several servers
//g_start_delay 15	// delay before the game starts to let players join the server first

// List of maps to play on the server.  Set to "" to autodetect (which would enumerate ALL maps.  Maps that don't support the current game mode will be skipped, so you don't need to remove them here.
//g_maplist "afterslime atelier boil catharsis courtfun dance drain erbium finalrage fuse geoplanetary glowplant implosion leave_em_behind nexballarena oilrig runningman runningmanctf silentsiege solarium space-elevator stormkeep techassault vorix warfare xoylent"
//g_maplist_shuffle 1	// 0 always selects the next map out of g_maplist (but then better set g_maplist_votable 0 below to prevent repetitive votes), 1 will select random maps each time
//g_maplist_mostrecent_count 3	// number of maps that have to be played before a map can be repeated

// LIMITS: how long a match will last before the next map starts (-1 means use the map default, 0 = unlimited, please note that the variables fraglimit/timelimit can NOT be globally used for this but only DURING a match is being played)
//timelimit_override -1	// global timelimit for all maps and gametypes
//fraglimit_override -1	// global frag/point limit for all maps and gametypes
//capturelimit_override -1	// capture limit for CTF
//g_domination_point_limit -1	// frag/point limit for DOM
//g_keyhunt_point_limit -1	// frag/point limit for KH
//g_lms_lives_override -1	// lives for LMS
//g_nexball_goallimit -1	// goals for NEXBALL

//g_ctf_ignore_frags 1	// set to 1 to ignore kills except for FC kills

// TEAMS for key hunt (change this to 2, 3, 4 to set a fixed keyhunt style)
//g_keyhunt_teams_override -1	// teams for KH

// GAME MODE: what type of server do you want to host?
// possible values: dm (deathmatch), tdm (team deathmatch), dom (domination), ctf (ctf), ft (freeze tag), lms (last man standing), ka (keepaway), inv (invasion), kh (keyhunt), as (assault), ons (onslaught), rc (race), nb (nexball)

g_maplist_check_waypoints 0	// set this to 1 to skip maps without waypoints if there aren't enough players to play without bots

g_maplist_votable 9	// number of maps to vote between.  set to 0 to disable the map voting screen (please enable g_maplist_shuffle above when this is enabled, or votes will be repetitive)

// Settings you MIGHT want to change for PRIVACY reasons.
//
// The settings here may impact your or your players' privacy and serve to
// optimize the game for further releases.
//
// Change them, or comment them out to turn them off.

// This line sends the following data to our servers:
// - Date and time
// - Your server IP address
// - Your server ID hash, which is a fingerprint of the public key of your
//   server and does not impact security of your private key (use "crypto_keys"
//   on the console to show it)
// - Your server name ("hostname")
// - Current game type
// - Current map
// - Balance settings you have modified from defaults (only those that make
//   your server "impure")
// - For each weapon pairing (A, B), separately for player-player, player-bot,
//   bot-player, bot-bot pairings:
//   - Number of hits of players/bots holding A against players/bots holding B
//   - Number of frags of players/bots holding A against players/bots holding B
//   - Total damage of players/bots holding A against players/bots holding B
//
// We use this data to:
// - Optimize the game balance for future releases
// - Identify problems in the bot AI and improving it
// - Find settings that make servers "impure" that should not, so we can
//   whitelist them in future releases
//
// We will or might publish:
// - Global weapon pairing statistics for players vs players, or bots vs bots,
//   or any vs any, on a selection of servers
// - Per-gametype and per-map weapon pairing statistics players vs players, or
//   bots vs bots, or any vs any, on a selection of servers
// - Lists of commonly changed cvars, together with counts on how often they
//   are modified
//
// No information about the players on the server is sent, so as a server admin
// you need no permission of your players for this.
//
// No information about your server will be published - all published data sets
// will include data from multiple servers.
